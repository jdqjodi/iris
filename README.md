A classic multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher, curated by Edgar Anderson to quantify the morphological variation of iris flowers of three related species.
The dataset contains 150 records under the attribtues of petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species.
Fisher developed a linear discriminat model to sort each species from the other.
